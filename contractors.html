            <h4>Deniece Tucker - Treasurer</h4>
            <p>
              Deniece was born and raised on her familyâ€™s farm located east of
              Troutdale near the Sandy River. The property was homesteaded in
              1853 and has been farmed since 1952. Deniece and her family
              historically raised cattle and grew raspberries but converted to
              growing nursery stock in 2001 due to market changes. A member of
              the Multnomah County Farm Bureau since 1999, Deniece joined the
              Board of Directors in 2000 and has served as the Board President
              (2007-2008) and Vice-President (2009-2018). Deniece is currently
              serving as the Board Treasurer. Deniece holds an Associate Degree
              in Accounting, is an Oregon licensed tax consultant, and is a
              federally licensed tax agent.
