          People have questions about farming. Whether members of the general
          public, students, industry representatives, government employees, or
          elected officials, when farm-related questions come up, people tend to
          turn to the usual information sources. These information sources often
          consist of friends, colleagues, books, the Internet, or academic
          experts. Rarely, though, do people have ready access to real farmers.
          Real farmers have unique experiences, knowledge, and understanding of
          land and farming techniques and issues. Farmers, local communities,
          and our society in general will benefit if people who are seeking to
          understand farming better have the ability to ask farmers directly.
          Given this, MCFB wants to connect people with questions about farming
          with real farmers. To accomplish this, we have established the “Ask a
          Farmer” program.

          <strong>Question: How do I start an agritourism business?</strong>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            First, note that it’s not as easy as it sounds… and success is not
            guaranteed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make a trip to the county zoning department or call them firsthand.
            Many folks have lost time and money not doing this first.
          </li>
          <li>
            In addition to the approval of the substantive agritourism activity,
            ensure onsite parking is available. Parking and local traffic are a
            real concern, especially in rural areas.
          </li>
          <li>
            Meet the neighbors and become friends. You will want and need the
            neighbors’ support to be successful.
          </li>
          <li>
            Note that farms with existing/longstanding agritourism appear
            somewhat “grandfathered” in as neighbors and the county are
            accustomed to the use. Given this, while not a guarantee, it might
            be best to start with a farm where there is a history of
            agritourism.
          </li>
        </ol>

            >Question: What’s it like to have a solar field on your
            farm?</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer: </strong>Solar fields had a lot of promise when they
          were first coming on board. They took some land out of production, but
          offered a good financial return with minimal inconvenience during
          their operational lifespan. Times are changing though and the
          cost-benefit isn’t penciling out as well. Each situation will have to
          be assessed on its own specific merits.

            small-scale local farmers?</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer: </strong>$19 billion directly to the ag sector. Of
          that $19 billion, $16 billion will be made in direct grants by USDA to
          farmers and ranchers to compensate for short-term drops in demand and
          oversupply driven by COVID19. The remaining $3 billion will go to
          purchase fresh produce, dairy, and meat to distribute to food banks,
          community organizations and charities.

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer: </strong>It’s not easy. Individuals matter. Some staff
          and agencies are very difficult to work with. The best you can hope
          for is to find a good staff person and establish a good working
          relationship with them as individuals.

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer: </strong> You must really love the work that you do in
          farming because it is hard work and long hours spent. You must be
          dedicated and willing to invest your time and money in the long term
          because generally your return on investment takes time.

            of agriculture?</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer: </strong> The Oregon Farm Bureau has over 15 advisory
          councils and committees; the Young Farmers & Ranchers Committee is
          just one of them... and one way the next generation of farmers and
          ranchers in Multnomah County can influence the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Question: Are farm plans helpful?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer: </strong> It depends a lot on the farmer and the
          situation. In many cases, farmers don’t have formal “farm plans.” At a
          minimum, farmers should assess their:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>assets (i.e., tractors, implements, soil type)</li>
          <li>budget</li>
          <li>preconceived crops and markets</li>
          <li>goals relative to being a full or part time farmer</li>
          <li>desired life style</li>
        </ul>
        <h5 class="mt-4">OBTAINING FARMLAND</h5>
        <p>
          <strong>Question: How do I find irrigated farmland to lease?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer: </strong> It’s very difficult. Most irrigated farmland
          is already leased and when it becomes available it’s often leased
          through word-of-mouth to neighbors and friends. Best option is to get
          to know farmers in the area you are looking to farm and let them know
          what you are looking for. Establish and maintain sincere relationships
          with the local farmers as available irrigated farmland may not become
          available for a time.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Question: How much does it cost to rent ag land?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer: </strong> Average lease rates in Multnomah County for
          non-irrigated farmland is $122/acre/year and for irrigate farmland is
          $256/acre/year.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >Question: Is there a lease premium for farmland that has been in
            the Conservation Reserve Program?</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer: </strong> Yes, although it’s difficult to say
          generally how much the premium would be. If land has been in a reserve
          program and out of production for several years, then that soil is
          probably in better condition and will be more productive than it would
          be otherwise. As such, the landowner can likely charge a lease premium
          for at least an initial period of time.
        </p>
        <h5 class="mt-4">WATER RIGHTS & IRRIGATION</h5>
        <p>
          <strong>Question: Do all crops have to be irrigated?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer: </strong> No, all crops do not require irrigation.
          Having said that, there are many variables that will determine the
          water needs of crops, including the species being grown, time of year,
          soils and slope, and weather. Irrigation will often expand flexibility
          on what is grown and how it is grown, and also may improve yields. For
          a nice summary on crops that don't require irrigation, see:

            >https://extension.oregonstate.edu/water/irrigation/why-do-i-need-water-rights-irrigation</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Question: How do you find a farm with water rights?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer #1: </strong> It's not easy, but you can start by
          talking to other farmers, inquiring with local water
          utilities/irrigation districts, and checking out the OWRD mapping tool
          at:
          <a href="https://apps.wrd.state.or.us/apps/gis/wr/Default.aspx"
            >https://apps.wrd.state.or.us/apps/gis/wr/Default.aspx</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer #2: </strong> Property with water rights are almost
          non-existent and often change hands without a sign going up. Sometimes
          rainwater harvesting for small farms is a partial answer. A number of
          CSA’s in the on (interruptible) community water systems. With drip
          irrigation, community water can be price efficient unless the water
          district cuts the water supply down to home use in the summer. Anyone
          wanting to start a farm should not depend on groundwater or surface
          water until the state gets a better groundwater recharge plan.
