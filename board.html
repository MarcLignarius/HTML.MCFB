          MCFB's Board of Directors must include a President and Secretary as
          Board Officers, and no less than one additional Board Director. The
          Board of Directors may choose to elect a Vice-President and Treasurer
          as additional Board Officers, and up to eight additional Board
          Directors. In addition, if there is a county Women's Committee and/or
          a Young Farmers and Ranchers Committee, the Chair of each committee
          shall be a voting member of the Board of Directors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Board Officers are elected by Voting Members each year at the Annual
          MCFB Meeting (see <a href="board-meetings.html">Board Meetings</a>).
          Other Board Directors, also elected at the Annual MCFB Meeting, serve
          staggered terms of two years. Only full MCFB Voting Members can serve
          on the Board of Directors. In addition to the Annual MCFB Meeting, the
          Board of Directors normally meets seven times throughout each year
          (see <a href="board-meetings.html">Board Meetings</a>).

            <h4>Al Garre - Board Director</h4>
            <p>
              Al’s grandfather started the family farm in northeast Portland in
              1920. Al took over the operation in 1984. The family farm has
              always grown fresh market vegetables. Since Al entered
              semi-retirement in 2018, the farm has produced a small amount of
              herbs. Al became an MCFB member when he took over the farm in
              1984. It was around that same time that he joined the MCFB Board.
              His current term as a Board Director expires in 2020. Al has
              always tried to actively support OFB and MCFB but feels he has
              gotten more out of the organization than he has given to it. It is
              Al’s firm belief that OFB and MCFB do more for family farms than
              any other group. Al received his Bachelor of Science in Mechanical
              Engineering in 1971 from Oregon State University.

            <h4>Angi Bailey - Secretary</h4>
            <p>
              Angi Bailey and her husband, Larry Bailey, have been running Verna
              Jean Nursery, which was started before she was born by Angi’s
              mother, since 2005. Angi is proud to continue the farming legacy
              started by her great-grandparents. Verna Jean Nursery, located
              east of Gresham, specializes in Japanese Maples, although they
              grow other varieties, including Monkey Puzzle Trees. The nursery
              itself has been an Oregon Farm Bureau (OFB) member since 1986.
              Angi and Larry took over the OFB membership in 2005 when they
              returned to the farm fulltime. Having grown up on the nursery,
              Angi has first-hand experience with the day-to-day challenges
              facing Oregon natural resources industries. Her extensive advocacy
              and communications training has given her the tools to be an
              effective voice for Oregon agriculture and forestry. In addition
              to being a board member for Multnomah County Farm Bureau, Angi was
              elected 1st vice president of Oregon Farm Bureau in 2019. Angi
              previously served as 2nd vice president for Oregon Farm Bureau and
              is a former board member of Oregon Agricultural Education
              Foundation. While she attended George Fox University in Newberg,
              Oregon for most of her college education, Angi received her
              Bachelor of Arts in Communication Arts from Seattle Pacific
              University.

              Deniece was born and raised on her family’s farm located east of
              Troutdale near the Sandy River. The property was homesteaded in
              1853 and has been farmed since 1952. Deniece and her family
              historically raised cattle and grew raspberries but converted to
              growing nursery stock in 2001 due to market changes. A member of
              the Multnomah County Farm Bureau since 1999, Deniece joined the
              Board of Directors in 2000 and has served as the Board President
              (2007-2008) and Vice-President (2009-2018). Deniece is currently
              serving as the Board Treasurer. Deniece holds an Associate Degree
              in Accounting, is an Oregon licensed tax consultant, and is a
              federally licensed tax agent.

              u-pick strawberries, and a fall pumpkin patch (with associated
              agritourism activities). Helen has been an MCFB member since 1988,
              served as the county Secretary and Treasurer for 25 years, and is
              now serving as a Board Director. Helen obtained a Bachelor of

            <p>
              Joe is a fourth-generation farmer in northeast Portland and
              currently farms alongside his daughter, Gabrielle Rossi. Joe and
              Gabrielle’s farm has always produced row crop fresh vegetables for
              sale and distribution in the Portland Metro area. As an urban
              farm, the location also avails itself to event space and farm
              tours. As a result, the farm is active in the community and the
              local Parkrose School District activities (the middle school and
              high school are built on two sections of the historic farm).
              Community and school engagement are traditions that Joe’s dad
              started and one that he continues today with Gabrielle. Being in
              an urban environment, the farm serves as a window into agriculture
              for our state. Joe and his family have been Multnomah County Farm
              Bureau members for more than 50 years. Joe became more involved
              when he joined the MCFB Board of Directors in 2018. Joe graduated
              from Parkrose High School and studied business at Portland State
              University before becoming a fulltime farmer.

              A native Oregonian, Larry comes from a farming family. His

              Board in 2009. Larry was elected the MCFB Board President in 2018.
